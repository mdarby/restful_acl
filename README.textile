h2. RESTful_ACL

A Ruby on Rails plugin that provides fine grained access control through the MVC stack to RESTful resources in a Ruby on Rails 2.0+ application. Authorization is as simple as true or false.

h3. What it does

RESTful_ACL is a simple Access Control Layer for Ruby on Rails. It restricts access on a fine-grained level to any RESTful MVC stack. Every application is different and everyone likes to setup their User / Account / Role resources differently; this plugin will allow you to do your thing and keep that thing locked down.

h3. Requirements

RESTful_ACL requires the super amazing "RESTful_Authentication":https://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication plugin.

h3. How to Install

Install the RESTful_ACL gem:
<pre>sudo gem install restful_acl -s http://gemcutter.org</pre>

Add the gem to your environment.rb file as thus:
<pre>config.gem "restful_acl"</pre>

RESTful_ACL requires two named routes: "error" and "denied". Add the following to your routes.rb file:
<pre>
  map.error 'error', :controller => 'some_controller', :action => 'error_action'
  map.denied 'denied', :controller => 'some_controller', :action => 'denied_action'
</pre>

h3. How to Use

h4. Controllers

Add @before_filter :has_permission?@ into any controller that you'd like to restrict access to (or application_controller.rb for your entire app).

h4. Models

Define a parent resource (if one exists) by using the @logical_parent@ method, and define the following five methods in the model of every resource you'd like to restrict access to. The five methods can contain anything you'd like so long as they return a boolean true or false. This allows you to define your User's roles any way you wish.

<pre>
  class Issue < ActiveRecord::Base
    logical_parent :some_model_name

    # This method checks permissions for the :index action
    def self.is_indexable_by(user, parent = nil)
    end

    # This method checks permissions for the :create and :new action
    def self.is_creatable_by(user, parent = nil)
    end

    # This method checks permissions for the :show action
    def is_readable_by(user, parent = nil)
    end

    # This method checks permissions for the :update and :edit action
    def is_updatable_by(user, parent = nil)
    end

    # This method checks permissions for the :destroy action
    def is_deletable_by(user, parent = nil)
    end
  end
</pre>

h4. Singleton Resources

RESTful_ACL 2.1+ supports singleton resources. Just pass @:singleton@ to the @logical_parent@

<pre>
  class Car < ActiveRecord::Base
    logical_parent :owner, :singleton
    ...
  end
</pre>

h4. View Helpers

There are five view helpers also included in RESTful_ACL: @#indexable@, @#creatable@, @#readable@, @#updatable@, and @#deletable@. These enable you to do nifty things like:
<pre>
= link_to ‘Foo Index’, foos_path if indexable
= link_to 'Edit Foo', edit_foo_path(@foo) if updatable(@foo)
= link_to 'Create Foo', new_foo_path if creatable
= link_to 'View Foo', foo_path(@foo) if readable(@foo)
= link_to 'Delete Foo', foo_path(@foo) if deletable(@foo), :method => :destroy
</pre>

h3. Huh? Here's an example

Let's say that you have two resources: Project and Issue. A Project has many Issues, an Issue belongs to a Project. I'd like to make sure that the current user is a member of the Project before they can create a new Issue in that Project:

<pre>
  class Issue < ActiveRecord::Base
    logical_parent :project

    belongs_to :author
    belongs_to :project

    def self.is_indexable_by(user, parent = nil)
      user.projects.include?(parent)
    end

    def self.is_creatable_by(user, parent = nil)
      user.projects.include?(parent)
    end

    def is_updatable_by(user, parent = nil)
      user == author && parent.is_active?
    end

    def is_deletable_by(user, parent = nil)
      user == author
    end

    def is_readable_by(user, parent = nil)
      user.projects.include?(parent)
    end
  end
</pre>

h3. Admins RULE!

RESTful_ACL grants global access to all actions to site administrators. To enable this, make sure that your User model defines an @is_admin?@ method *and/or* an @is_admin@ attribute. If the @current_user.is_admin?@ returns true, access will be granted automatically.

h3. How to Test

I normally do something along these lines in RSpec:
<pre>
  describe "Issue" do
    before do
      @project = mock_model(Project)
      @author  = mock_model(User, :projects => [@project])

      @issue = Issue.factory_girl(:issue, :author => @author, :project => @project)
    end

    it "should be modifiable by the author when the Project is active" do
      @project.stub!(:is_active? => true)
      @issue.is_updatable_by(@author, @project).should be_true
    end

    it "should be deletable by the author" do
      @issue.is_deletable_by(@author, @project).should be_true
    end

    it "should be readable by those assigned to the Project" do
      Issue.is_readable_by(@author, @project).should be_true
    end

    it "should be creatable by those assigned to the Project" do
      Issue.is_creatable_by(@author, @project).should be_true
    end
  end
</pre>
